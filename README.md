# Raven
Raven is a cms made in python. It is in ***VERY*** early alpha. 

## How YOU can help
Work on some of the goals listed in the [goals](goals.md) file

## Dependencies

Linux-only due to requiring sudo to run any python file without asking for a password **MASSIVE SECURITY HOLE** I dont know how to fix it though. Should work under WSL alas with some config to the sudoers file.

### Package requirements

```
pip install beautifulsoup4 markdown feedgen
```

## Special Thanks
Raven wouldn't be possible without the following contributions.

John Gruber for creating markdown

Myke Hurley at The Enthusiast for the base design of the example site

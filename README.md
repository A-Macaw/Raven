# Raven
Raven is a cms made in python. It is in ***VERY*** early alpha. 

## How YOU can help
Work on some of the goals listed in the [goals](goals.md) file

If you edit any of the configs. Dont change the values just for style. The example values are boring intentionally. 
Only edit the config to add new values.

The main edits should go to the Scripts
